NUI Based Game Design
This project was interesting and quite complicated, this is about learning to design a game, understanding that what is natural user interface and implementing NUI over a designed game. We designed a balloon game, there are balloons falling and there is a needle to explode them. Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Premiere, Unity is used to create the game and C#, Javascript used for scripts. In order to control game we used OpenCV and Python programming language is used to implement this program, we select object from the webcam and track it and we are sending the coordinations to Unity. We seperated our group into two, one of us created the game and the other one implemented OpenCV.
